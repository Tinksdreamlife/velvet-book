# The Velvet Book

This is Tink's second JavaScript project. The title is a combined reference to the world of accounting in which account entries used to be in a dedicated book, as well as to the luxury fantasy element of adult entertaining. (Velvet, symbolic for power, wealth, and sophistication, was originally made from silk. In a similar fashion, the adult entertainment world was originally created to be "luxury" entertainment that only the rich could afford.) 

Tink, a professional dancer, writer, and content creator, recognized a need within the professional adult entertainment community and developed this app to fill it. After years of trying to find accountants who understood the nuances of the industry to help track the financial side (and until 2023, no accountant specifically served the spicy industry), Tink developed a system to properly track income and expenses for independent contractors in this industry. 

NOTE: The final version of the app will be in partnership with a financial professional to ensure users of the app are given current and relevant experiences while using the app.
